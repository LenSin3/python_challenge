  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
 
 The above tasks were done in jupyter notebook budget.ipynb and the results were written in a csv file titled budget_solved.csv found in the resources folder.

 
 2. PyPoll Challenge.
 The Pypoll challenge involved the analysis of a set of poll data stored in election_data.csv. The tasks include
 
 * The total number of votes cast.

 3. Extra Content
 Extra challenges done include
 
 a. PyBoss Challenge involved converting employee records to a required format. The original records are stored in employee_data.csv and the tasks were done in jupyter notebook pyboss.ipynb.
 Tasks carried out:
 
 * The `Name` column should be split into separate `First Name` and `Last Name` columns.

  * The `DOB` data should be re-written into `MM/DD/YYYY` format.

  * The `SSN` data should be re-written such that the first five numbers are hidden from view.

  * The `State` data should be re-written as simple two-letter abbreviations.
  
 The new format were written in pyboss_solved.csv.
 
b. PyParagraph Challenge.
Analysis of text data was carried out to find the following:

* Import a text file filled with a paragraph of your choosing.

* Assess the passage for each of the following:

  * Approximate word count

  * Approximate sentence count
